## Inspiration
In 2018, about 1 in 59 children is diagnosed with autism. Treatments are expensive and over-booked, parents couldnâ€™t afford more accompanying time.

**Visual communication** is more effective than text for intellectual and social development of children with autism. 

## What it does

With our "sketch captioning" technology, they can join conversation with AI via drawing!

## How I built it

- We built a CNN model served on **SPELL**.
- We built a webpage with **webflow** for interaction including (user) drawing sketches and making conversation.
- We used GCP service to synthesis text-to-speech read aloud to users.

- We **interviewed** with multiple autism-related institutions and physicians in China to understand the pain points of early autism treatment.
- We **validated** our ideas on a medical basis under professional guidance.

## Challenges I ran into


- We co-developed with **SPELL** team to overcome difficulties in this newly-released product.
- We maintained interactiveness of our web app while keep it good-looking with **webflow**.
- We encountered two new technologies (**SPELL**, **webflow**) and learned to leverage them efficiently.
